# Huffman Coding
Huffman Encoding is one of the simplest algorithms to compress data. Even though it is very old and simple, it is still widely used.
In this project I implemented Huffman encoding and decoding.

# How to use
## Run the program with these command line arguments:  
To compress:   
```
hc -c input_file
```
This will generate a binary file called input_file.hc    

To decompress:    
```
hc -d input_file.hc 
```
